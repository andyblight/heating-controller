# Progress

This documents the progress that I have made and what I plan to do next.  I
find that this sort of ducment is essential as I only have short periods of
time to work on this project.

## BUGS

## TODO

* Add name for each sensor that is visible to IP address scanners (like on
my phone).

## DONE

* One of the temperature sensors is acting broadcasting on the same channel as
my wireless access points and this kills the signal in my office.  The other
temperature sensors works fine.
* Scraper to record data from external weather stations.
* Scraper to record data from temperature sensors.
* Temperature and humidity sensors.
